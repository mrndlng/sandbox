		<div>
		<p>Every time I think of you
		<br>I feel shot right through with a bolt of blue
		<br>It's no problem of mine
		<br>But it's a problem I find
		<br>Living a life that I can't leave behind
		<br>But there's no sense in telling me
		<br>The wisdom of the fool won't set you free
		<br>But that's the way that it goes
		<br>And it's what nobody knows
		<br>Well every day my confusion grows<br>
		<br>Every time I see you falling
		<br>I get down on my knees and pray
		<br>I'm waiting for that final moment
		<br>You say the words that I can't say<br>
		<br>I feel fine and I feel good
		<br>I'm feeling like I never should
		<br>Whenever I get this way
		<br>I just don't know what to say
		<br>Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday
		<br>I'm not sure what this could mean
		<br>I don't think you're what you seem
		<br>I do admit to myself
		<br>That if I hurt someone else
		<br>Then I'll never see just what we're meant to be<br>
		<br>Every time I see you falling
		<br>I get down on my knees and pray
		<br>I'm waiting for that final moment
		<br>You say the words that I can't say<br>
